## Context
In software development, choosing the appropriate approach for solution modeling and generation is crucial for project success. Traditional top-down approaches often involve starting with high-level requirements and gradually refining them into detailed designs and implementations. However, this approach can sometimes lead to disconnects between the initial requirements and the final solution, especially in complex projects with evolving needs.

## Decision
To address the limitations of traditional top-down approaches and better align with the dynamic nature of modern software development, we have decided to adopt a bottom-up solution modeling and generation approach for our PoC.

## Consequences

- Granular Understanding: By starting with smaller, more granular components or modules and gradually composing them into larger systems, we can gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain and the specific requirements of each component.
- Iterative Development: Bottom-up approaches encourage iterative development and refinement, allowing us to continuously validate and adjust our solution based on feedback and changing requirements.
- Modularity and Reusability: Breaking down the solution into smaller, reusable modules promotes modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and extend the system over time.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Bottom-up approaches are inherently more flexible and adaptable to change, as they allow us to evolve the solution incrementally based on emerging needs and priorities.
- Efficient Resource Utilization: By focusing on smaller, manageable units of work, we can optimize resource utilization and minimize dependencies between teams or modules.

## Conclusion
Adopting a bottom-up solution modeling and generation approach aligns with our goals of delivering flexible, maintainable, and scalable software solutions that can adapt to changing requirements and market conditions. This approach empowers our teams to iterate rapidly, collaborate effectively, and deliver value to our customers more efficiently.
